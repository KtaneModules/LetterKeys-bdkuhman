Then, download the latest release of the module, and drop theLetterfolder into the '<path>/<to>/Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes/mods' folder. (If the folder doesn't exist, create one for it).

Finally, run Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, enable mods, and then you should be getting this module in play!
